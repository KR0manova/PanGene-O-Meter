# PanGene-O-Meter
Quantifying bacterial genomes' gene-content similarity and gene-content-based de-duplication

Introduction
============
Bacterial genome evolution is shaped to a great extent by horizontal gene transfer, detectable as genes with a presence-absence pattern of variation that does not follow phylogenetic relationships across the majority of the genome. While average nucleotide identity (ANI) is the most common measure to measure bacterial genome similarity, its ability to capture gene-content differences is limited, and is use therefore often misses a major factor for functional variability. **PanGene-O-Meter provide an orthogonal gene-content-based method to quantify similarity between bacterial genomes, leveraging knowledge of pan-genome structure and relationships between orthology groups.** PanGene-O-Meter, provides a higher level of granularity than ANI when classifying bacterial isolates of the same species. Furthermore, PanGene-O-Meter is useful for efficient bacterial genomes clustering, allowing for facile selection of one or several 'representative' genomes, effectively de-duplicating a set of genomes by their gene content.

## Pipeline overview
1.	Orthology group assignment: Assign predicted genes to orthology groups (pangenes) to constructing a pan-genome (different methods can be used for this step).
2.	Phyletic pattern representation: Represent each genome as a binary presence/absence (P/A) vector, where each element corresponds to a pangene and the value is either 1 (present) or 0 (absent).
3.	Gene-content similarity (GCS) calculation: Calculate GCS based on Jaccard similarity \($GCSj$\) between the P/A vectors of two bacterial genomes \($pS1$ and $pS2$\):

$$GCSj(pS1,pS2)=\frac{M11}{(M01+M10+M11)}$$

Where $M11$ represents the total number of elements (orthology-groups) for which both $pS1$ and $pS2$ have a value of 1; $M01$ represents the total number of elements for which the value of $pS1$ is $0$ and $pS1$ is $1$; and $M10$ represents the total number of elements for which the value of $pS1$ is $1$ and the value of $pS2$ is $0$.</span>

Alternatively, the GCS can be defined by the shared pangenes, based on their overlap coefficient \($GCSo$\).  This approach reduces the impact of partial genomes on the GCS metric.

$$GCSo(pS1,pS2)=\frac{M11}{(min(M01+M11,M10+M11))}$$

4. **GeneContRep**, a greedy incremental clustering algorithm to deduplicate a list of genomes. GeneContRep, allows the selection of representative genomes according to specific gene-content similarity cutoffs.

## How to run
PanGene-O-Meter requires a file containing a list of annotated genomes in [*GenBank Flat File*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/samplerecord/) format for analysis, 
<br>specified with the `--in_gbk` argument, and an output directory, designated by the `--outDir` argument. 
<br>`--threads ` sets the number of CPU cores \[default=1\].

**So for example:**

``PanGeneOmeter.pl --in_gbk list_of_gbk  --outDir  output_directory --threads 64``

* To see all supported parameters run: ` PanGeneOmeter.pl -h `

## Command line arguments
### Mandatory parameters:
* `--in_gbk_list_file <File>`: Specify the path to the file containing a list of genomes to be analyzed, each in [*GenBank Flat File*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/samplerecord/) format.
* `--outDir <Directory>`: Provide the full path to the directory where output files will be saved.
### Additional (optional) parameters:
#### General Parameters:
* `--prefix_name <Prefix>`: Specify a prefix to be added to the names of the output files. Default is an empty string (""), meaning no prefix will be used.
* `--metadata_file <File>`: Provide the path to a tab-delimited file containing metadata and descriptions for the genomes being analyzed. Default is an empty string (""). If not provided, metadata will be automatically extracted from the GenBank file.
* `--threads <Number>`: Set the number of threads to use for parallel processing. The default is `1`, meaning the program will use a single thread.
* `--help`: Display help information and exit the program.

#### PanGenome Construction Parameters:
* `--pangenome_alg <Algorithm>`: Choose the algorithm for PanGenome construction. Options are `PanX` or `DIAMONDClust`. The default option is `PanX`.
* `--diamond_pid <Percentage>:` Set the percentage identity for clustering sequences when using `DIAMONDClust`. The default is `80`.
* `--diamond_cover <Coverage Cutoff>`: Define the mutual coverage cutoff for use in `DIAMONDClust`. The default value is `70`.
* `--reuse_PanGenome`: If this option is specified, the PanGenome construction step will be skipped, and existing files from previous runs in the output directory will be reused. By default, the program will override and execute all steps anew.

#### *GeneContRep* Clustering Parameters:
* `--GCS_method <Method>`: Select the gene-content similarity metric to be used in the *GeneContRep* step. Options are `GCSj` or `GCSJo`, with the default being `GCSj`.
